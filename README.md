# BeeStation Public

## This is a fork of the BeeStation 13 Codebase, where everyone is a contributor with push access.  
## Don't worrry, the original BeeCode is still safe and sound.

# Rules
### - Git commit messages must be accurately descriptive of what they change, any vague or dishonest commits will be removed.
### - Do not meaninglessly destroy others' code.
